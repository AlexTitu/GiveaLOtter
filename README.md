# Application coding for an Android platform - Give A L'Otter
In a three students team we have built an original Android app named Give A L'Otter. We have used BitBucket for versioning the app, the versioning system being Git. The app coding was realized in Android Studio, using Java language for back-end and XML for front end. The main purpose of the app is to give people an online place where they can ask, give and receive gift ideas for the people close to them. Users are connecting to a database and they are creating an account. Through the account they can ask for gift ideas by describing the person they are going to buy or make the gift for, the occasion the are giving the gift for, what hobbies the person has and any other helping details, without telling any personal information about the person they are giving the gift to. We have also implemented a currency inside the app so we will not encounter the situation where there will be many questions for gift ideas and very few answers. By adding the currency, in order to be able to pose a request for an idea, you have to answer to a few other requests first, and your answers have to be bought. The database in which the accounts, the requests for ideas of gifts and the answers to the posts are saved it is hosted with Google Firebase.

The archive contains the project and source code of the application developed in Android Studio.
